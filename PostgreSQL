I have listed the top five assignments based on total value of donations, categorized by donor type. 

I have then identified the assignment with the highest impact score in each region, 
ensuring that each listed assignment has received at least one donation.

WITH sum_donations AS(
	SELECT 
	d.assignment_id,
	donors.donor_type,
	SUM(d.amount) AS total_donation_amount
	FROM donations as d
	LEFT JOIN donors
	ON d.donor_id = donors.donor_id
	GROUP BY d.assignment_id, donors.donor_type
	)

SELECT 
	donor_type, ROUND(total_donation_amount, 2) AS rounded_total_donation_amount, 
	a.region, a.assignment_name
	FROM sum_donations AS sd
	LEFT JOIN assignments AS a
	ON sd.assignment_id = a.assignment_id
	ORDER BY rounded_total_donation_amount DESC
	LIMIT 5;

WITH assignment_impact AS(
	SELECT a.assignment_name, a.region, a.impact_score, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT d.donation_id) AS num_total_donations
	FROM assignments AS a
	LEFT JOIN donations AS d
	ON a.assignment_id = d.assignment_id
	GROUP BY assignment_name, region, impact_score
),
	top_impact AS(
	SELECT assignment_name, region, num_total_donations, impact_score,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY region ORDER BY impact_score DESC) AS rnk
	FROM assignment_impact
	)

SELECT assignment_name, region, num_total_donations, impact_score
FROM top_impact
WHERE rnk = 1
